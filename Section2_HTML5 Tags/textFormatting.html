        <p>
            <b>I am a bold tag!</b>
            <strong>I am a strong text.</strong>
            <i> I am a italic text. </i>
            <em>I am just inclined text.</em>
            <br>
            <u>i am an underlined text.</u>
            <ins>I am an inserted text.</ins>
            <br>
            <s>I am strike tag.</s> 
            <del> I am a delete tag that does the same as a strike tag.</del>   
            <br>

            So then we have one, three, four, five and six.
            We are also multiline editing inside Vaskov second click on this one and hold all and click on the other
            one to continue to code.
            Have been it together.
            So I'm going to do this gensets to score to three and it's going to be four.
            That's five.
            And then we have had six.
            So these are the different types of how this thing looks like inside the browser and save this as good
            old Broza and hit refresh see Hetson being the largest heading and has six being the smallest one.
            Let me show you how to create a paragraph so you can just type in P that creates a paragraph also called
            as free style.
            So inside that I'm going to type in Lorem.
            So Lauren is a dummy text.
            You can always use it.
            So once you type in lorem just hit on the tab key that's going to automatically fill in some dummy text.
            So what has happened is that created a huge line which I have to scroll.
            I'm going to break this into multiple lines.
